5.6 Pointer Arrays; Pointers to Pointers

Let us illustrate by writing a program that will sort a set of text lines into alphabetic order, a
stripped-down version of the UNIX program  sort .

我们在第3章写过一个能够对整数排序的shell sort，并在第4章使用quicksort改进了它。
该算法在此同样有效，但是现在处理的是长度不一的文本行，而且不同于整数的是，它们不能在单个操作中比较和移动。
我们需要一个能够高效，方便地处理变长文本行的数据表示法。
In Chapter 3, we presented a Shell sort function that would sort an array of integers, and in
Chapter 4 we improved on it with a quicksort. The same algorithms will work, except that now
we have to deal with lines of text, which are of different lengths, and which, unlike integers,
can't be compared or moved in a single operation. We need a data representation that will cope
efficiently and conveniently with variable-length text lines.
